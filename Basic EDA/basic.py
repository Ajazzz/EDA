# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step in any data analysis project, 
# as it helps to understand the data and its characteristics. In Python, there are various libraries that you can use for EDA, 
# including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Here's a basic EDA workflow in Python:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
