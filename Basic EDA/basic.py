''' Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step in any data analysis project, 
# as it helps to understand the data and its characteristics. In Python, there are various libraries that you can use for EDA, 
# including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Here's a basic EDA workflow in Python:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns


# Load data: Load the data into a Pandas dataframe using the read_csv function.
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Get an overview of the data: Use the head() and tail() functions to view the first and last rows of the dataframe, respectively. 
#Also, use the info() function to get information about the data types of each column and the describe() function to get basic statistical information about the dataframe.

print(df.head())
print(df.tail())
print(df.info())
print(df.describe())

# Handling missing values: Check if there are any missing values in the dataset using the isnull() and sum() functions.

print(df.isnull().sum())

# Visualizing data: Use visualizations to understand the data. 
# You can use Matplotlib or Seaborn to create various types of plots, such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and bar plots

# Histogram
sns.histplot(data=df, x='column_name')

# Scatter plot
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='column_name_1', y='column_name_2')

# Box plot
sns.boxplot(data=df, x='column_name')

# Bar plot
sns.countplot(data=df, x='column_name')


# Correlation analysis: Check for correlations between variables using the corr() function, and visualize the correlations using a heatmap.

# Correlation matrix
corr_matrix = df.corr()

# Heatmap
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')

# This is just a basic EDA workflow in Python. You can customize this workflow based on the specific requirements of your project.
